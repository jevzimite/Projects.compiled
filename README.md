# Projects.compiled
Most of the projects I have done in R since I started as a begining.

They are very disorganized, however, most of the data used in the models can also be found in the repository

This repo is just meant to be a back-up for my code and as a brief showcase of my experience in R,
if interested in a particular script that is not functional please reach out at www.linkedin.com/in/joseemiliovelz
